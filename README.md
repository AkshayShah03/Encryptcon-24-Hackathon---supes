# Green Finance Analytics

## Overview

Green Finance Analytics is a sophisticated tool designed to empower users in evaluating green energy projects and making informed decisions in the green stock market. This comprehensive solution is split into two main categories:

### a) Green Energy Project Proposal Evaluation

This module involves the detailed assessment of green energy project proposals, providing users with a holistic view of viability, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores, and risk factors. The process is as follows:

1. **Dynamic Dataset Creation:**
    - The tool uses a curated dataset derived from extensive research within the green finance market.
    - The dataset, consisting of 50+ entries, dynamically updates as users respond to the frontend questionnaire.

2. **ESG Score Generation:**
    - A BERT-based model analyzes project summaries to generate precise ESG scores.
    - ESG scores encompass environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices.

3. **Viability Score Calculation:**
    - Viability scores are determined by evaluating the business details of each company.
    - The scoring system provides a quantifiable metric to assess the potential success of the proposed green energy projects.

4. **Risk Factor Assessment:**
    - Geographical considerations are factored into a risk assessment model.
    - The tool evaluates potential challenges associated with the geographical location of each project.

### b) Green Stock Investment Advisory

This module focuses on studying current trends in green stocks and offering personalized stock recommendations based on an individual's risk tolerance. The process includes:

1. **Current Trend Analysis:**
    - Proprietary algorithms analyze the current trends in the green stock market.
    - Recommendations are tailored to individual risk preferences on a scale of 1 to 5.

2. **Stock Suggestions:**
    - Recommendations consider factors such as financial performance, market trends, and sustainability metrics.
