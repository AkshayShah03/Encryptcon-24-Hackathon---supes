# Green Finance Analytics

## Overview

The Green Finance Analytics project provides a comprehensive solution for evaluating green energy projects and making informed investment decisions in the green stock market. It is divided into two main components:

### Green Energy Project Proposal Evaluation

This component involves the assessment of green energy project proposals, generating viability scores, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores, and risk scores. The process includes creating a dynamic dataset based on user responses, utilizing a BERT-based model for ESG scoring, and evaluating viability and risk factors.

### Green Stock Investment Advisory

The second component focuses on analyzing current trends in green stocks and suggesting the best stocks for investment based on an individual's risk tolerance (on a scale of 1 to 5). The recommendations consider factors such as financial performance, market trends, and sustainability metrics.
